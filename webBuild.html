            <h2>Project Summary + Reflection</h2>
            <p>Using the web wireframe I created in Figma, I built a web version of the app. It had been years since I touched HTML or CSS, so getting started was definitely rough. But as I kept working on it, everything slowly started coming back to me, and I even picked up a few new things along the way.</p>
            <p>For someone who only remembers the basics of HTML and CSS, I’m genuinely proud of what I was able to put together. Translating a mobile layout into a desktop version also helped me understand how much the design needs to shift when you’re working with a bigger screen. It made me think more about responsive design and how different elements should reorganize themselves.</p>
            <p>If I were to redo this in the future, I’d love to build out more pages and start adding JavaScript so the buttons actually function and the whole thing behaves more like a real site. Even though it was challenging, creating the web version gave me a better sense of how the app could work as a full system—not just a mobile experience.</p>
