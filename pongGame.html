        <h3>When I made this game, it was originally done in the Processsing environment. Because Processing doesnt use all Pythin Libraries and methods, I challenged myself to recreate the same game using PyGame. Though the product doesnt work the same as the original project, the process taught me a lot about pygame and how to research to solve coding problems.</h3>
